# Moon Phase Observation Log

## Instructions
1. **Print this log** (or copy the table onto your own paper).
2. **Every evening**, look at the moon and draw its shape in the circle.
3. **Label the phase** (new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, last quarter, waning crescent).
4. **Write the date and time** of your observation.
5. **Optional:** Note the weather conditions and any interesting things you see (stars, planets, clouds).

## Observation Tips
- The moon rises about 50 minutes later each day.
- You don't have to observe every single day; even a few observations per week will show the pattern.
- Use a pair of binoculars for a closer look at craters and seas.
- If it's cloudy, you can write "cloudy" and try again the next clear night.

## Phase Guide
- **New Moon:** The moon is not visible (or a tiny sliver).
- **Waxing Crescent:** A small sliver on the right side, growing larger each night.
- **First Quarter:** The right half is illuminated (looks like a half‑circle).
- **Waxing Gibbous:** More than half lit on the right side, but not yet full.
- **Full Moon:** The entire face is illuminated.
- **Waning Gibbous:** More than half lit on the left side, shrinking.
- **Last Quarter:** The left half is illuminated (half‑circle on the left).
- **Waning Crescent:** A small sliver on the left side, shrinking to new moon.

## What to Look For
- **Craters:** The dark spots are impact craters.
- **Maria (Seas):** The large dark areas are ancient lava plains.
- **Terminator:** The line between light and dark shows shadows that make craters stand out.

## Fun Challenge
Can you predict the phase of the moon one week from today? Write your prediction and check later to see if you were right!

## Share Your Log
When you finish a month of observations, share a photo of your log with your teacher or family. You could even create a poster showing how the moon changed over the month.
