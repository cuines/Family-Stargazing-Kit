# Solar System Scale Model Activity

## Introduction
Welcome to the Solar System Scale Model activity! This guide will help you and your family understand the vast distances between planets by creating a scale model using everyday fruit and household items.

## Materials Needed
- A large open space (park, playground, or long hallway)
- Measuring tape or a long piece of string
- The following fruits/objects (adjust sizes based on availability):
  - Mercury: peppercorn or small bead
  - Venus: blueberry or small grape
  - Earth: grape or large marble
  - Mars: small strawberry or cherry tomato
  - Jupiter: basketball or large melon
  - Saturn: soccer ball or slightly smaller melon
  - Uranus: softball or medium orange
  - Neptune: softball or medium orange (similar size to Uranus)
- Printable planet labels (included at the end of this guide)
- Pen and paper for notes

## Scale
We'll use a scale where **1 meter = 1 million kilometers**. This means the distances between planets will be much smaller than in reality, but still large enough to walk through.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Choose Your Location**
   Find a flat, open area at least 50 meters long. A school field or empty parking lot works well.

2. **Place the Sun**
   Start at one end. Place a large yellow ball (or draw a circle) to represent the Sun.

3. **Measure and Place the Inner Planets**
   - **Mercury:** 0.6 meters from the Sun – place the peppercorn.
   - **Venus:** 1.1 meters from the Sun – place the blueberry.
   - **Earth:** 1.5 meters from the Sun – place the grape.
   - **Mars:** 2.3 meters from the Sun – place the small strawberry.

4. **Measure and Place the Outer Planets**
   - **Jupiter:** 7.8 meters from the Sun – place the basketball.
   - **Saturn:** 14.3 meters from the Sun – place the soccer ball.
   - **Uranus:** 28.7 meters from the Sun – place the softball.
   - **Neptune:** 45.0 meters from the Sun – place the other softball.

5. **Add Labels**
   Tape the printable labels next to each planet. Read the fun fact on each label aloud as you place it.

6. **Discuss and Explore**
   Walk from the Sun to Neptune. Notice how the inner planets are close together, while the outer planets are spread far apart. Talk about why space travel takes so long!

## Fun Facts
- **Mercury** is the smallest planet and has no atmosphere.
- **Venus** is the hottest planet because of its thick carbon dioxide atmosphere.
- **Earth** is the only planet known to support life.
- **Mars** is called the "Red Planet" because of iron oxide (rust) on its surface.
- **Jupiter** is so large that all the other planets could fit inside it.
- **Saturn** has beautiful rings made of ice and rock particles.
- **Uranus** rotates on its side, like a rolling ball.
- **Neptune** has the strongest winds in the solar system.

## Printable Planet Labels
Cut out the squares below and tape them next to each fruit.

```

## Share Your Model
Take pictures of your scale model and share them with your teacher or on social media using the hashtag **#FamilyStargazingKit**. We'd love to see your creations!

## Adaptations for Younger Learners
- Use larger, more colorful fruit to make it easier to handle.
- Skip the exact measurements and just place the planets in order.
- Turn it into a scavenger hunt: hide the fruit and have children find them in the correct order.

## Safety Note
Always supervise children with small objects that could be a choking hazard. Clean up all fruit after the activity to avoid attracting animals.
