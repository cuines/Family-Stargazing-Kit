# Glossary of Astronomical Terms

## A
**Asteroid** – A small rocky body orbiting the Sun, mostly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

**Astronaut** – A person trained to travel and work in space.

**Astronomy** – The scientific study of celestial objects (stars, planets, galaxies) and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere.

**Atmosphere** – The layer of gases surrounding a planet or moon, held in place by gravity.

## B
**Black hole** – A region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.

## C
**Comet** – A small icy body that orbits the Sun. When it comes close to the Sun, it heats up and releases gas and dust, forming a glowing coma and sometimes a tail.

**Constellation** – A group of stars that form a recognizable pattern in the sky, often named after mythological characters, animals, or objects.

**Crater** – A bowl‑shaped depression on the surface of a planet, moon, or asteroid, usually caused by the impact of a meteoroid.

## D
**Day** – The time it takes for a planet to rotate once on its axis.

**Dwarf planet** – A celestial body that orbits the Sun, is round in shape, but has not cleared its orbit of other debris (e.g., Pluto, Ceres, Eris).

## E
**Eclipse** – When one celestial body moves into the shadow of another. A **solar eclipse** happens when the Moon blocks the Sun; a **lunar eclipse** happens when Earth blocks sunlight from reaching the Moon.

**Equator** – An imaginary line around the middle of a planet, halfway between the North and South Poles.

**Exoplanet** – A planet that orbits a star other than our Sun.

## F
**Full moon** – The phase of the Moon when its entire face is illuminated as seen from Earth.

## G
**Galaxy** – A huge collection of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity. Our solar system is part of the Milky Way galaxy.

**Gravity** – The force that attracts two objects toward each other. It keeps planets in orbit around the Sun and holds galaxies together.

## H
**Hemisphere** – Half of a sphere. Earth is divided into the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere by the equator.

## L
**Light‑year** – The distance that light travels in one year, about 9.5 trillion kilometers (5.9 trillion miles). It is a unit of distance, not time.

## M
**Meteor** – A streak of light in the sky caused by a small piece of space debris (a meteoroid) burning up in Earth's atmosphere. Often called a "shooting star."

**Meteorite** – A meteoroid that survives its passage through the atmosphere and lands on the ground.

**Meteoroid** – A small rocky or metallic body traveling through space, smaller than an asteroid.

**Milky Way** – The galaxy that contains our solar system. From Earth, it appears as a faint band of light across the night sky.

**Moon** – A natural satellite that orbits a planet. Earth has one moon; other planets have many moons.

## N
**Nebula** – A giant cloud of gas and dust in space. Some nebulae are regions where new stars are born; others are the remains of dead stars.

**New moon** – The phase of the Moon when it is between Earth and the Sun, and its illuminated side is facing away from us, making it invisible in the night sky.

**North Star (Polaris)** – A bright star that appears almost directly above Earth's North Pole. It is used for navigation because it seems to stay in the same place while other stars appear to rotate around it.

## O
**Orbit** – The path that one object takes around another object due to gravity. For example, Earth orbits the Sun, and the Moon orbits Earth.

## P
**Planet** – A large celestial body that orbits a star, is round in shape, and has cleared its orbit of other debris. Our solar system has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

**Planetary system** – A set of planets, moons, asteroids, and other objects orbiting a star.

## R
**Revolution** – The movement of one object around another. Earth's revolution around the Sun takes one year.

**Rotation** – The spinning of an object around its own axis. Earth's rotation causes day and night.

## S
**Satellite** – Any object that orbits a planet or star. Natural satellites are moons; artificial satellites are human‑made machines launched into space.

**Solar system** – The Sun and everything that orbits it: planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other small bodies.

**Star** – A massive, luminous sphere of plasma held together by gravity. Stars produce light and heat through nuclear fusion. Our Sun is a star.

**Sun** – The star at the center of our solar system. It provides light and heat that make life on Earth possible.

## T
**Telescope** – An instrument that uses lenses or mirrors to gather and focus light, making distant objects appear larger and clearer.

**Terminator** – The line that separates the illuminated part of a celestial body (like the Moon) from the dark part.

## U
**Universe** – All of space, time, matter, and energy that exists. It includes everything from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies.

## W
**Waxing** – The phase of the Moon when the illuminated portion visible from Earth is increasing (from new moon to full moon).

**Waning** – The phase of the Moon when the illuminated portion visible from Earth is decreasing (from full moon to new moon).

## Z
**Zenith** – The point in the sky directly above an observer.

**Zodiac** – A band of constellations through which the Sun, Moon, and planets appear to move across the sky.
